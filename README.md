You may compile the provided C++ code on your Raspberry Pi (or any system with a C++ compiler) using the following command:

bash
g++ -o uds_function_server uds_function_server.cpp -lpthread


This will produce an executable named `uds_function_server`. You can then run the server with:

bash
./uds_function_server


Remember to ensure that you have the necessary permissions for the socket path, and you may need to adjust the code for specific nuances of your environment or requirements.
